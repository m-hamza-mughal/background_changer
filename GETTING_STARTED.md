# Getting Started with Background Changer

After installing required dependencies from [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), you need to specify input and output directory paths and formats in a config file. 
Or simply, you can place you images or videos in [test_data](data/test_data)

Sample file can be found in [configs](configs)

Run this command by passing config file as an argument
```
python ./tools/run_algo.py --cfg configs/BIISC.yaml
```

The files will be generated in your output directory.
